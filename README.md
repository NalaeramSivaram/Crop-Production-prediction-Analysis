# Crop-Production-prediction-Analysis
In this project the given data has been processed and transformed then EDA(exploratory Data Analysis) has been carried out.
After EDA process Regression models has been analysed and selected.
Then streamlit has been used to show the prediction. 
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing is the process of preparing raw data for analysis and machine learning by removing errors, handling missing values, converting data types, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. This ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and structured, making it suitable for training models and drawing meaningful insights.

**Key Steps in Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    1.Handling Missing Values – Filling or removing empty data points.
    2.Removing Duplicates – Eliminating redundant records.
    3.Fixing Data Types – Converting data into appropriate formats (e.g., integers, floats).
    4.Handling Outliers – Removing extreme values that could distort analysis.
    5.Encoding Categorical Data – Converting text categories into numerical values.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and summarizing datasets to understand their main characteristics, detect patterns, identify anomalies, and extract useful insights using statistical and visualization techniques.

**Key Steps in EDA:**
    1.Understanding Data Structure – Checking dataset dimensions, column names, and data types.
    2.Handling Missing Values – Identifying and addressing missing data.
    3.Summary Statistics – Calculating mean, median, variance, and distribution.
    4.Detecting Outliers – Identifying extreme values using boxplots or z-scores.
    5.Data Visualization – Using histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.
    6.Feature Relationships – Finding correlations between variables.
EDA helps in data cleaning, feature selection, and model preparation, making it a crucial step in any data science workflow.
After EDA process the Trends has been Visualization

**Model Building: Regression**
        Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features. It identifies relationships between dependent (target) and independent (input) variables.
    Steps in Model Building
    1. Data Preparation
    2️. Splitting Data
    3️. Choosing the Regression Model
    4️. Training the Model
    5️. Evaluating the Model
    6️. Making Predictions
    7️. Improving the Model

**Streamlit app**
    The streamlit app has been used to display the prediction result. Predicting crop yield based on year, country, crop type, area harvested, and yield per hectare using Random Forest Regression or XGBoost Regression
